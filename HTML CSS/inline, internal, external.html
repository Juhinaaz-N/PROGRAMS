    <h1><b>NATURE</b></h1>
    <p style="color:blue; background-color: aqua;">Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects, the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.</p>
    <p style="color:bisque; background-color: brown;">Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components.</p>
