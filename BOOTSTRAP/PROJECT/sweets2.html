        <h3>FERRERO ROCHER</h3>
        <p>The hazelnut centre surrounded by filling, wafer, chocolate, and hazelnut bits is a fantastic combination. These have a hazelnut flavour to them, and I'd like to see more chocolate in them. They're delicious, so sweet, and moreish, and they're a family favourite.</p>
